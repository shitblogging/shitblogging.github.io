                    Well, it's officially Christmas time. Look, I love Christmas and all, but something doesn't feel right this year. It shouldn't already be December. There isn't even snow on the ground where I live, and I'm 100% sure there won't be any for Christmas either. Whatever. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Joyous Kwanzaa, Happy Whatever-The-Fuck-Else.

                    I am a totally responsible and very capable webmaster. I definitely did not forget about this blog until just now. It has totally not been 3 months. Your brain is lying to you,

                    I stuck my finger in nacho cheese today

                    Today was garbage day, so I began cleaning out my fridge to throw the old leftovers away. Nearly two weeks ago, we had nachos for dinner, and a heart-stopping amount of nacho cheese was made. Most of it didn't get eaten, so we threw it in a tupperware dish and forgot about it. Until today. 
                    <br>
                    I grabbed a spoon to help me empty out the cheese into the trash can, but somehow I MISSED THE DISH WITH THE SPOON and stuck my finger right in the two week old nacho cheese. It's been 4 hours and I'm still made about it. Thank you.

                    Today I discovered my new favorite word. I plan to start sprinkling it into all of my conversations. I would apologize in advance but honestly? I'm not sorry.

                    Michael is my name and total nihilism is my game B). I was born on the west side of Michigan, and raised on the east side. I've taught myself how to program things and sites, and make CSS templates for fun. Kinda pathetic.
